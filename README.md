## FirstCry Product Data Analysis Project
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project investigating the pricing, discounting, and product attributes in the FirstCry product dataset. This project uncovers insights to optimize pricing strategies, identify product trends, and support better business decisions in inventory and customer segmentation.

# ✨ Project Overview
This analysis focuses on understanding the dynamics of product pricing and attributes in the FirstCry catalog, aiming to:

Analyze original price, discounted price, and club price distributions

Investigate discount patterns and pricing strategies

Explore relationships between product features and pricing

Identify data quality issues and perform extensive data cleaning

Uncover insights to guide pricing optimization and inventory decisions

The project combines univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to deliver actionable insights for business stakeholders.

# 📊 Key Insights

✅ Pricing Trends

Original and discounted prices are right-skewed, with most products priced lower and few premium outliers

Strong positive correlation between original price, discounted price, and club price

Discount percentages vary significantly, indicating non-uniform discount strategies

✅ Categorical Analysis

Many products fall under an “Other” category, suggesting gaps in product classification

Majority of sleeve types recorded as “Unknown,” revealing missing data issues

✅ Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Original price strongly correlates with both discounted and club prices

Discount percent shows weak correlation with prices, suggesting diverse discounting strategies

Certain product attributes influence pricing and may help in better product segmentation

✅ Data Cleaning Highlights

Removed irrelevant columns and duplicates

Fixed structural errors and inconsistent formats

Filled missing values where appropriate

Converted data types for accurate analysis
